# Smart-Irrigation-Monitoring-System
This is a IOT project which monitors temperature, humidity and soil moisture from the raspberry pi and sends the same data to the cloud. 
This data can be viewed lively in both Web and Android...

This was coded for the Hack4Throne Competition on 24th Aug 2017. :)
